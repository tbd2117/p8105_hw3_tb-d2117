```

### Problem 1

Loading Intracart data.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

**Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illstrative examples of observations.**

``` r
order_df=
instacart %>% 
  group_by(order_id) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_item = n(),
    n_reorder = sum(reordered)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(reorder_pct = n_reorder / n_item)
```

The *instacart* dataset constains data on products ordered through a
online grocery service that allows you to shop online from local stores.
Each row in the dataset is a product from an order (there is a single
order per user in this dataset). The dataset has 1384617 rows and 15
columns. It contains products from 131209 orders with an average 10.55
items per order. In each order, on average, 60.25% of items are
reordered.

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?**

``` r
aisle_df =
  instacart %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    summarize(
      n_item = n()
    ) %>%
    arrange(desc(n_item))
```

There are 134 aisles with most itens ordered from the following aisles:
fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yogurt,
packaged cheese, water seltzer sparkling water.

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
aisle_df %>% 
  filter(n_item > 10000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, desc(n_item)), y = n_item)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1)
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in each Aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered",
    caption = "Limited by aisles with more than 10,000 items orderd"
  )
```

**Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.**

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  select(aisle, product_name) %>%
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
  summarise(
    n_item = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_item)) %>%
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = str_to_title(aisle)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Aisle", "Product Name", "Number of Times Ordered"), 
    align = "lcr"
  )
```

| Aisle                      |                 Product Name                  | Number of Times Ordered |

| Packaged Vegetables Fruits |              Organic Blueberries              |                    4966 |

**Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).**

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  select(product_name, order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = case_when(
    order_dow == 0 ~ "Sunday",
    order_dow == 1 ~ "Monday",
    order_dow == 2 ~ "Tuesday",
    order_dow == 3 ~ "Wednesday",
    order_dow == 4 ~ "Thursday",
    order_dow == 5 ~ "Friday",
    order_dow == 6 ~ "Saturday",
    TRUE ~ "")
  ) %>%
  rename("Product Name" = product_name) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| Product Name     |   Sunday |   Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 |  15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
